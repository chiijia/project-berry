# Schema Design – Dream Analyzer

The application uses a **relational database (MariaDB)** to manage users and their dream records. Below is the schema breakdown:

---

## Database Name  
```
dream_analyzer
```

---

## Table: `users`

Stores registered user information.

| Column     | Type          | Attributes                     | Description                      |
|------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `id`       | INT           | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT    | Unique user ID                   |
| `username` | VARCHAR(255)  | UNIQUE, NOT NULL               | Username for login               |
| `password` | VARCHAR(255)  | NOT NULL                       | Hashed password                  |

 **Note**: Passwords are stored using `password_hash()` for security.

---

## Table: `dreams`

Stores submitted dream records along with extracted keywords.

| Column        | Type      | Attributes                         | Description                                  |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | INT       | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT        | Unique dream record ID                       |
| `user_id`     | INT       | FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES `users(id)`| The user who submitted the dream             |
| `description` | TEXT      | NOT NULL                           | Full dream text as described by the user     |
| `keywords`    | TEXT      | NULLABLE                           | Extracted keywords (comma-separated)         |
| `created_at`  | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP          | When the dream was submitted                 |

 **Keyword Mapping**: Keywords like `"water"`, `"flying"`, `"death"` are detected in `analyze.php` and stored in the `keywords` field.

---

##  Database User (MariaDB)

A dedicated MariaDB user is created for this system:

```sql
CREATE USER 'dream_analyzer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'open';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dream_analyzer.* TO 'dream_analyzer'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

##  Relationship Diagram

```
users (1) ────< dreams (many)
```

- One user can submit many dreams.
- Each dream belongs to exactly one user.

##  Future Expansion Suggestions

| Feature                    | Suggestion                                     |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Emotion tagging           | Add a new column `emotion VARCHAR(50)`         |
| Keyword normalization     | Create a separate `keywords` table with many-to-many mapping |
| Admin roles               | Add `role` column in `users` table             |
