Project Title
Simple Dream Analyzer
High-Level Functionalities
This application is a keyword-based dream interpretation platform. Users can input a description of their dream, and the system will match it with a predefined keyword database to return a relevant psychological interpretation. The goal is to provide a simple, fun, and functional dream analysis experience without requiring users to register or log in.
Main features include:
1. Dream Input: Users can type in a text description of their dream on the front-end page.
2. Keyword Matching: The system checks for specific keywords in the dream text using a small keyword database.
3. Interpretation Display: Based on matched keywords, the system returns corresponding dream interpretations.
4. Immediate Feedback: Interpretations are displayed instantly below the input box without needing to reload the page.
Example Scenario 1: User Inputs a Dream and Gets an Interpretation
User Description:
- Name: Emily
- Age: 21
- Background: A psychology student interested in dreams but not well-versed in theory.
- Goal: She wants to understand what it means when she dreams about flying.
Interaction Flow:
1. Emily opens the web page and sees a simple input box.
2. She types: “I was flying through the air last night” and clicks the "Analyze" button.
3. The system receives the input, and PHP converts the sentence to lowercase and splits it into words.
4. PHP matches words like “flying” with the database and retrieves the corresponding interpretation.
System Response:
The system displays: “Flying often symbolizes freedom, control, or escaping reality.”
The interpretation is shown directly below the input without page reload.
Technical Notes:
- PHP Logic: Handles user input, keyword splitting, and database lookup.
- Database Query: SELECT interpretation FROM dreams WHERE dream_type LIKE '%flying%'
- Database Table: Table `dreams` with columns: id, dream_type, interpretation
Example Scenario 2: User Inputs Another Dream and Gets a Different Interpretation
User Description:
- Name: Kevin
- Age: 33
- Background: An office worker experiencing stress and frequent dreams.
- Goal: He wants to know what it means when he dreams of being chased by a monster.
Interaction Flow:
1. Kevin opens the page and types: “I was being chased by a monster.”
2. The system receives the input and detects keywords like “monster” and “chased.”
3. PHP queries the database for interpretations of these keywords.
System Response:
The system displays: “Being chased often relates to anxiety or avoiding pressure. Monsters may represent internal fears or unknown threats.”
Technical Notes:
- PHP Logic: Uses simple string matching to detect multiple keywords and returns combined interpretations.
- Database Query:
  SELECT interpretation FROM dreams WHERE dream_type IN ('monster', 'chased');
- The results are merged and displayed together.
Summary
This Simple Dream Analyzer project:
- Focuses on keyword matching and returning interpretations.
- Uses HTML + CSS + JavaScript for front-end, and PHP + MariaDB for back-end.
- Does not require login, user accounts, charts, or discussion forums.
- Ideal for beginner teams using Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W + LAMP stack.
- Provides a good foundation for future expansions (e.g., visualizations or NLP-based analysis).
